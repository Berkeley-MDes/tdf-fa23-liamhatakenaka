### _Reflections_

Being that I had never used Rhino/Grasshopper before, when this phone stand project was introduced I was admittedly a bit indimidated. This intimidation only increased when I downloaded the files and was met with an interface that was equally confusing as it was overwhelming. For a good while I sat in front of my computer, not entirely sure what I was looking at, afraid to "mess up" the file I had opened. Thankfully, Kyle mentioned his Rhino tutorials (80 hours!) and directed me to the "Drafting 1" section, which familiarized me with the general UI of Rhino. 

From there, I was able to start playing around with the 'CellPhoneStand_DrawingsForProduction_2D.3dm" file. Being that I did the bulk of my work in Rhino over the weekend and Monday morning (before our second TDF class), I was not aware that the use of Grasshopper on some of the other provided files would aid me in manipulating the dimensions of my phonestand. Because of this, I had to really get familiar with how to manipulate objects. For this, Google really became my friend. At one point I had several tabs open, all reading something like, "how to measure length of a line in Rhino", "how to measure angles in Rhino", and "how to insert control points in Rhino". Other than the use of the command line (which came in very handy), many of the gestures I made were surprisingly similar to those I have done in programs like Illustrator and Figma.
